1.1,,Be slow and gentle when manipulating the colony in order to as much as possible keep the bees calm
1.2,Be aware of the reactions of honey bees to smoke;,"Bees fear for the colony, ingest nectar/honey, and in doing so make themselves full, heavy and less inclined to sting"
1.2,,Make sure smoke not too hot or too much smoke is applied as the Bees may react badly
1.3,Be aware of the personal equipment needed to open a colony of honey bees and the importance of its cleanliness;,"Essential – suit, gloves, smoker, hive tool, spare fuel and lighter"

1.10,,Demonstrate responsible temporary storage of removed frames: perhaps in a spare brood box or carefully propped against the hive or even leaning against the queen excluder which might be leaning up to the hive entrance
1.10,,"Do not “roll” bees, but use space made to move frames along then slowly lift them out"
1.10,,"Once found, some beekeepers temporarily trap the queen in a matchbox or queen cage to avoid losing or damaging her"
1.10,,"Recognise and comment on brood pattern (colour, age, type etc.), brace comb and spacing"

1.12,Be able to identify brood at all stages;,"Eggs, larvae, pupae (sealed in cells)"
1.13,"Be able to demonstrate the difference between drone, worker and honey cappings;",Honey cappings are paler and waxier
1.13,,Brood cappings are various biscuit shades and look more fibrous in texture
1.13,,Drone cells have a larger surface area and are deeper (longer) too
1.14,"Be able to identify stored nectar, honey and pollen;","Nectar is clear and uncapped,"

1.19,Be able to discuss the concept of the bee space and its significance in the modern beehive;,The height of a bee 3/8thinch or 6-9 mm
1.19,,It is the crawl space needed by the bee to pass easily between two structures
1.19,,Not so small they will propolise it <6mm
1.19,,Not to large they will brace comb it > 9mm
1.19,,Vertically you must opt for top or bottom bee space and not mix the two

1.20,,Nail up into both bottom bars
1.21,Be able to discuss spacing of the combs in the brood chamber and super for both foundation and drawn comb and methods used to achieve this spacing.,Wax foundation encourages bees to build the desired (worker or drone) sized cells in an orderly manner across the whole available surface
1.21,,Brood chamber – bee space (11 or 12 frames in National)
1.21,,"Spacing can be achieved using Hoffman Frames, castellated spacers, metal or plastic ends"
1.21,,Super frames can be set wider once drawn comb is employed so more honey is stored per frame using either different castellations or size of end spacers
2.1,Be able to give an elementary account of the development of queens. workers and drones in the honey bee colony;,Queen: Egg – laid in or moved by workers to queen cell (like monkey nut hanging down)

2.2,,Adult emerges: Queen - day 16; Worker - day 21; Drone - day 24
2.2,,"Death: Queen - Upto 5 years but 2-3 years in reality due beekeeper; Worker - About 6 weeks, but 3- 6 months in winter; Drone - Until Autumn if not mated, otherwise after mating"
2.3,Be able to name the main local flora from which honey bees gather pollen and nectar;,"Very Early – crocus, snowdrops, flowering currant, hazel"

2.3,,"Autumn – blackberries, ivy, willowherb"
2.4,"Be able to give a simple definition of nectar and a simple description of how it is collected, brought back to the hive and is converted into honey;",Nectar is a sugar substance created by flowers to entice insects to visit
2.4,,"Nectar is up to 80% water, bees have a preference lower water content nectar"
2.4,,Nectar is ingested by the bee into its honey stomack and regurgitated back at the hive
2.4,,Hive bees add enzymes to the nectar to break down its complex sugars and then store it in the comb
2.4,,Nectar is fanned to evaporate and reduce water content to about 18% at which point it will not ferment
2.4,,"Finally, when ripe it is sealed under capping of wax"
2.4,,Nectar - Collection: Carried from flowers in honey stomach of foraging bees then processed into honey by hive bees

2.5,,Pollen -  Use: Food – protein for growth
2.5,,Propolis - Collection: Carried from plant wounds and buds in pollen baskets
2.5,,Propolis - Use: Seal cracks in hive; Reinforce and clean old comb; Entomb dead animals in hive; Limits bacterial and fungal growth;
2.5,,Water - Collection: Carried in [honey] stomach; some bees are speiclaist water collectors
2.5,,Water - Use: Mixed with honey before bees eat it or feed to brood; Used to cool hive on hot days – action of evaporation
